## Quickstart

### Requirements

- Python 3.10–3.12
- PyTorch 2.5.1 + CUDA 12.4
- Transformers 4.43.x

Training is an independent Python project. Its [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml),
[`uv.lock`](uv.lock), `.venv`, and CUDA wheel index are separate from the
inference project at the repository root.

**Minimum hardware (as shipped — `shell/train_u1/{8B,A3B,U1.5_8B}.sh` defaults):**

| Model | GPUs (minimum) | HBM / GPU | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `8B.sh` (dense) | **1 × 8** | 80 GB | `wp=8 × tp=1 × pp=1 = 8` ranks; `seq_len=28672`, `num_imgs=144` |
| `U1.5_8B.sh` (pixel-head PT) | **1 × 8** | 80 GB | Same topology; `seq_len=8192`, up to 1024² generation |
| `A3B.sh` (MoE)  | **2 × 8** | 80 GB | `wp=8 × tp=2 × pp=1 = 16` ranks required by ISP; same seq budget |

To fit on smaller setups, reduce `seq_len` / `num_imgs` (memory) and / or
`wp_size` / `tp_size` (topology) at the top of the launcher.

```bash
# From the repository root (recommended):
uv --directory training sync --locked
uv --directory training sync --locked --extra flash-build
uv --directory training sync --locked --extra flash-build --extra flash \
  --no-build-isolation-package flash-attn
source training/.venv/bin/activate

# Or run the equivalent commands from training/:
cd training
uv sync --locked
uv sync --locked --extra flash-build
uv sync --locked --extra flash-build --extra flash \
  --no-build-isolation-package flash-attn
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The repository's CUDA training configurations set `use_flash_attn=True`, so
the `flash` extra is required for the shipped launchers. The first two syncs
install the matching Torch/CUDA environment and Flash Attention's build tools;
the final sync builds the extension against that environment. You can install a
compatible prebuilt wheel instead of the final command when one is available.

For environments without uv, use the generated direct-dependency requirements.
pip will resolve compatible transitive versions; use uv with `uv.lock` for the
exact reference environment.

```bash
cd training
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements-flash-build.txt
python -m pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -r requirements-flash.txt
python -m pip install -e . --no-deps
```

`pyproject.toml` is the source of truth for direct dependencies and version
ranges, `uv.lock` contains the exact resolution, and `requirements*.txt` files
mirror only the relevant pyproject dependency lists. The separate
`requirements-flash-build.txt` and `requirements-flash.txt` preserve the required
build order for this compiled extension. Do not edit generated requirements by
hand. Repository maintainers can refresh both projects' locks and requirements
from the repository root with
`./scripts/lock_and_export_dependencies.sh`.

Other accelerator kernels such as Apex, `grouped_gemm`, and `deeplink_ext`
remain configuration-specific and must be installed separately with builds
matching the training Torch/CUDA environment.

### Configure your environment

The launchers are plain `torchrun` wrappers — edit `shell/train_u1/{8B,A3B,U1.5_8B}.sh`
and set at least:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH` | HF weights to initialize from (or `LLM_PATH` + `VIT_PATH` + `MLP_PATH` for component-wise loading) |
| `VOCAB_FILE`, `TOKENIZER_PATH` | Qwen3 tokenizer directory (same path is fine for both) |
| `mm_data_path` | dataset meta JSON (see `data/sample/sample_data_meta.json` for the schema) |
| `JOB_NAME` | unique name for the run; outputs land under `RUN/$JOB_NAME/` |

Distributed topology is also env-var driven (defaults shown):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NPROC_PER_NODE` | 8 | GPUs per node |
| `NNODES` | 1 | Number of nodes |
| `NODE_RANK` | 0 | This node's rank in `[0, NNODES)` |
| `MASTER_ADDR` | 127.0.0.1 | Rendezvous host (rank-0 node's IP) |
| `MASTER_PORT` | 29500 | Rendezvous port |

All other knobs (`seq_len`, `total_steps`, `lr`, parallelism sizes,
flow-matching schedule, CFG drop probabilities, ...) are also env-var
overrideable. See [`configs/sensenovavl_qwen3_gen/`][configs] for the full
list of consumers.

U1.5 records the inexpensive loss/throughput counters every step and samples
the duplicate full-vocabulary accuracy/perplexity monitor every 10 steps by
default. Set `metric_interval_steps=1` to restore per-step monitoring or use a
larger positive interval when profiling compute throughput. Allocator memory
diagnostics follow `data.empty_cache_and_diag_interval`; the framework does not
flush the CUDA caching allocator at step zero.

### Launch a training run

```bash
# 8B smoke test — single node, 8 GPUs.
bash shell/train_u1/8B.sh

# U1.5 8B generation pre-training with the Pixel Shuffle convolution head.
bash shell/train_u1/U1.5_8B.sh

# A3B requires 2 nodes (wp × tp = 16 ranks under ISP) — run on each node,
# replacing NODE_RANK / MASTER_ADDR:
NNODES=2 NODE_RANK=0 MASTER_ADDR=10.0.0.1 bash shell/train_u1/A3B.sh
NNODES=2 NODE_RANK=1 MASTER_ADDR=10.0.0.1 bash shell/train_u1/A3B.sh
```

Outputs are written to `RUN/$JOB_NAME/$TIMESTAMP/{logs,tensorboards,shell}/`.
A successful run prints `step=0 loss=…` after model load and dataset
warm-up (typically 3–5 minutes for A3B on 16 H800s).

## Tasks supported

| Task | Notes |
|---|---|
| `mm_t2i` |  Text-to-image generation |
| `mm_it2i` |  Image editing (single- or multi-input) |
| `mm_interleave_gen` | Interleaved text + image generation |
| `mm_interleaved` | Interleaved text/image understanding |
| `multimodal` (OCR, VQA, …) |  Generic multimodal understanding |

Loss is automatically bucketed per task for logging, so you can monitor
each capability separately on TensorBoard / W&B.

---

## Configuration deep-dive

- **Sequence packing.** All samples are packed into a single fixed-length
  sequence (`seq_len`) per micro-batch. Per-document attention is enforced
  by FlexAttention block masks. The packing budget is
  `max_packed_tokens = seq_len`, `num_images_expected = num_imgs`.
- **Parallelism.** `parallel.tensor.mode='isp'` enables Intern Sequence
  Parallel; combined with `weight.size=wp_size` (FSDP-like weight
  sharding) and `zero1.size=-1` (full DP ZeRO-1). Pipeline parallel is
  disabled (`pp_size=1`) in shipped configs.
- **Flow-matching schedule.** `time_schedule={standard,dynamic}` with
  `time_shift_type={exponential,linear}`; `P_mean`, `P_std` control
  the logit-normal timestep sampling. `noise_scale_mode={fixed,resolution,
  dynamic}` adapts the noise floor to the image's token count.
- **CFG drop.** Classifier-free-guidance training drop is governed by
  `cfg_txt_uncond_drop_prob`, `cfg_img_uncond_drop_prob`,
  `cfg_txtimg_uncond_drop_prob`, with `cfg_is_uncond_drop_independent`
  toggling independent vs. mutually-exclusive draws.

## Data

### Sample dataset (smoke test)

A tiny illustrative meta JSON, jsonl annotations, and the matching
image / video assets are released as a separate Hugging Face dataset:

**[`SenseNova/SenseNova-U1-Training-Sample`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SenseNova/SenseNova-U1-Training-Sample)** (~680 MB)

Download it into `training/data/` before launching a run:

```bash
huggingface-cli download \
    SenseNova/SenseNova-U1-Training-Sample \
    --repo-type dataset \
    --local-dir training/data
```

The unpacked layout matches the paths in
`training/data/sample/sample_data_meta.json` — no path rewriting needed,
the shipped `shell/train_u1/{8B,A3B}.sh` will pick it up directly. The
sample is sized to exercise every task type (see the table above), **not**
to produce a usable model.

### Real training

For real training, prepare your own data in the same schema:

1. Write jsonl files (one sample per line; each sample is a
   `{conversations, image, ...}` dict; see the sample jsonls in the HF
   dataset for the exact shape).
2. Build a meta JSON listing your datasets with `root`, `annotation`,
   `repeat_time`, and `task` fields (modeled after
   `sample/sample_data_meta.json` in the HF dataset).
3. Set `mm_data_path` to that meta JSON in your shell script.

A standalone data-prep guide is on the TODO list; PRs welcome.

## Project status

This repository was extracted from a larger internal codebase and reduced
to the training-only surface area. 

What's in scope:

- Distributed training of SenseNova-U1 (8B dense and 38B-A3B MoE) and U1.5 8B generation PT
- Mixed task training across the five `type_id` categories above
- Streaming-resumable data loading with checkpoint state
- HF-format checkpoint export via [`tools/revert2hf.py`](tools/revert2hf.py)
  (see the next section).

---

## Checkpoint conversion (internevo → HuggingFace)

Training writes checkpoints in the internevo shard layout (`model_wp{N}_pp0.pt`
plus optional `model_moe_layer{L}_expert{E}_wp{W}.pt` for MoE). To consume one
of these from `transformers` / `safetensors`, convert with:

```bash
python tools/revert2hf.py \
    --src /path/to/RUN/<job>/<step> \
    --tgt /path/to/output/hf_dir \
    --extras-from /path/to/reference-hf-model    # optional: copies config.json + tokenizer
```

The same command works for both **dense** (8B) and **MoE** (A3B) checkpoints —
MoE shards are auto-detected and the MoT U/G dual-branch experts are routed to
`mlp.experts.*` and `mlp_mot_gen.experts.*` respectively. Output layout matches
the publicly-released checkpoints:

- `model-{NNNNN}-of-00016.safetensors` — dense (vit, mlp1, fm_modules, llm dense weights, MoE gates)
- `moemodel-{NNNNN}-of-{N}.safetensors` — one per LLM MoE layer (both branches)
- `model.safetensors.index.json` — combined index
- `config.json` + tokenizer files — copied from `--extras-from` if provided

The tool streams shards via `torch.load(mmap=True)` and processes one output
slice at a time, so it runs comfortably inside ~32GB cgroup limits even for >100GB MoE checkpoints.
